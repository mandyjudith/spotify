# Spotify Music Genre Classification



## Project Overview
Spotify is the worldâ€™s biggest music streaming platform by a significant proportion 
Among the goals for our project, we want to create a new genre that softens the boundary between existing genres - allowing customers from fringe groups to transition into listening to a broader choice of music.
From analyzing the data we have gathered on the more niche genres of music streamed by our customers: 
we have made a proposition in diversifying existing genres and again attracting  people with all kinds of music preferences.
